<h1>The Auto Watering system (AWS)</h1>

<h2>The Idea And The Goal of Project</h2>
<p>
Hello,
Thanks For visiting The project
The Goal Of The Project is to Manage Watering plants and trees 
The Project is Working With Modern and advanced sensors
That Can Get Temperature, Humidity and The Amount of water in the soil
and Then Show it in Lcd 

in soon as possible we will Add To The Project A Small Pump 
To Auto water The Plants And The Trees
but Now The Project Just Show Data of The Plant in The LCD Screen And The code too
</p>

<h2>How The Project Work</h2>
<p>
The Project First Get Data From Sensors
Then Show The Data in a LCD Screen as shown below:

            water needed / water is fine
      Temp is good / Temp is not good : Temperature

as We Said Before The Project Don't Water The Plant yet
it's just showing The Data And Reading in The Lcd Screen But As Soon As possiple
We Will ad A Small Pump And Edit The Code To work with pump
in this case The project will water The Plant Automaticly without Touching it
</p>

# How would I Build My Project Basing on This Code?
<p>
You Need First of All To Have Some Requirments You Can Acces it on The File ```requirments.txt```
Then Make The Circuit on A Breadboard Or PCB If You Want
