Hello,
Thanks For visiting The project
The Goal Of The Project is to Manage Watering plants and trees 
The Project is Working With Modern and advanced sensors
That Can Get Temperature, Humidity and The Amount of water in the soil
and Then Show it in Lcd 
we have Added A Small Pump To The Project And The Code Updated on Github For That
</p>

# How The Project Work
<p>
The Project First Get Data From Sensors
Then Show The Data in a LCD Screen as shown below:

            water needed / water is fine
      Temp is good / Temp is not good : Temperature

Then if water needed The Pump will automaticly Water The Planet Until reaching The good water Level
</p>

# How would I Build My Project Basing on This Code?
<p>
You Need First of All To Have Some Requirments You Can Acces it on The File ```requirments.txt```
Then Make The Circuit on A Breadboard Or PCB If You Want
</p>
